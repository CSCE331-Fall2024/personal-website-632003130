                <h1>Howdy! My name is Skanda Nagaraja, Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I am an enthusiastic and dedicated third-year Computer Science student at Texas A&M University, deeply engrossed in the dynamic field of machine learning. My academic and professional journey in artificial intelligence started of curiosity and has blossomed into a focused commitment to harness its potential, especially in enhancing financial technologies and other sectors. Additionally, in my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, working on cars, and playing golf.Â  During my recent internship, I gained hands-on experience with building data pipelines, as well as interacting with CRM frameworks like Microsoft Dynamics. These experiences not only solidified my technical expertise in data analysis, programming, and statistics but also sparked a stronger interest in developing innovative AI solutions that are efficient and applicable to modern-day problems.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My portfolio is designed to reflect my academic accomplishments, practical projects, and significant professional milestones as I continue to delve deeper into machine learning. As I actively seek new roles and collaborative opportunities, I am eager to contribute to and learn from the cutting edge of AI development & Software Engineering. As you pursue my portfolio, take a step into the landscape of synthesizing the next creative monopoly with sustainable development as the backend. Join me on this journey of exploring the crossroads of what the next generation of software engineering can bring us: solving problems, fostering innovation, etc. Together, let's harness the power of AI to create a brighter and more data-driven future. Post-graduation, I hope to work in a Software Engineering, or equivalent, role - cultivating the necessary skills and tools to make myself knowledgeable in the tech landscape. Once I feel like I'm in a good place, I hope to exit the industry and start something of my own - the next creative monopoly. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if there is anything in my portfolio that resonates with you. </p>
